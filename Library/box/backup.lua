---# Builtin `box.backup` submodule
---
---The `box.backup` submodule contains two functions that are helpful for [backup](doc://admin-backups) in certain situations.
box.backup = {}

---Informs the server that activities related to the removal of outdated backups must be suspended.
---
---To guarantee an opportunity to copy these files, Tarantool will not delete them.
---But there will be no read-only mode and checkpoints will continue by schedule as usual.

---**Return:** a table with the names of snapshot and vinyl files that should be copied
---
---**Example:**
---
--- ```tarantoolsession
--- tarantool> box.backup.start()
--- ---
--- - - ./00000000000000000015.snap
--- - ./00000000000000000000.vylog
--- - ./513/0/00000000000000000002.index
--- - ./513/0/00000000000000000002.run
--- ...
--- ```
---
---@param n? number *Since Tarantool 1.10.1* an argument that indicates the checkpoint to use relative to the latest checkpoint. For example `n = 0` means "backup will be based on the latest checkpoint", `n = 1` means "backup will be based on the first checkpoint before the latest checkpoint (counting backwards)", and so on. The default value for n is zero.
---@return string[]
function box.backup.start(n) end

---Informs the server that normal operations may resume.
function box.backup.stop() end
